Scribbles from the Scala course at Coursera

This repo contains some practice code and random notes from the scala [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1). The course follows along the contents of the [Scala by Example](http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaByExample.pdf) book.

Honoring the coursera honor code, I'll omit solutions to the HW problems.
